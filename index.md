#### Democratising AI <span style="color:#440027;font-size:small"></span>
Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming our livesâ€”from the way students learn and parents make decisions, to how educators teach and adapt. But access to clear, trustworthy, and inclusive information about AI hasn't kept pace with its influence.

This site exists to help close that gap.

#### Why This Matters

AI is shaping decision-making in education, healthcare, social media, and beyond. While it promises great benefits, it also brings risks like bias, privacy concerns, and misinformation. These issues arenâ€™t just technicalâ€”theyâ€™re social and human.

If we want AI to serve people fairly, we need to democratise understanding of how it works and how it affects us.

##### We created this platform for:
- **Educators**, integrating AI into teaching and curriculum
- **Parents**, navigating AI tools in family life
- **Students**, growing up surrounded by intelligent systems

Whether you're guiding others or just getting started, our goal is to make AI more transparent and approachable.
